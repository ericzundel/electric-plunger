This is the repo for a project that builds an Electric Plunger.  

ATTRIBUTION:

The plunger circuit and software was written by Eric Z. Ayers.

The plunger circuit is originally based on:

  The Arduino Project: 
    http://arduino.cc
  The Adafruit wave shield by Limor Fried: 
    http://adafruit.com

The software uses:

  The Arduino development environment (version 17) downloadable from:
    http://arduino.cc
  The WaveHC library by Bill Greiman (fat16): 
    http://code.google.com/p/wavehc
  Which in turn was based on Limor Fried's AF_Wave library:
    http;//ladyada.net/

In addition, I used AVRStudio and an AVRISPmkII to flash the bootloader
to the ATMega386P.
