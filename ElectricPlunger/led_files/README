These files are the data to drive the LED display.  Format is ASCII.

Each line describes a pattern to display in the LED matrix.  The line length
is 65 characters (including a terminating newline)  The files can be arbitrarily
long.  As a practical matter, the SD cars has a lot of capacity, and since 
there is a stutter in the music when opening a new file, it would be
better to make fewer long files than lots of short files.

The first 4 characters are 4 ascii digits [0-9] that encode the time to display
this sequence in milliseconds.  

The next 60 characters descrive the values for each of the rows.
0 == LED off
1-4 == LED on

(Originally, the matrix could display different intensitites, but when playing 
music and driving the LED, there was unacceptable flickering)

Examples:

Display the first row for 1 second:
1000111111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Display the second row for 1 second:
1000000000111111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Display the first column for 1 second
1000100000100000100000100000100000100000100000100000100000100000

Display all leds on for a quarter second, then turn them off 
for a quarter second:
