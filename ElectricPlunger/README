These sketches are a part of the Electric Plunger project.

The plunger has LEDs on its handle that light up and make a show.
There are electronics and a speaker in the base.  The circuit contains
a DAC to play music and a sdcard reader for storing data.

circuit - schematics and board files used to design the electronics.

led_matrix_development - a sketch that drives the LED matrix as a state
    machine.  This was in preparation for writing the LedMatrix library.

led_matrix_demo - a sketch that demonstrates using the LedMatrix library.

led_files - Some sample .led files that are read by the plunger_driver project

photos - Photos of the development of the projecct.

plunger_driver - The code that was actually loaded into the electric plunger
    to read .wav and .led files and display them.
