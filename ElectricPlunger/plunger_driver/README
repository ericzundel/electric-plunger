This is the driver shipped with the original Electric plunger on 26 Aug.

It plays .wav files and flashes the LED matrix.
The .wav and .led files must reside in the root directory

The WaveHC file is from http://code.google.com/p/WaveHC
The LedMatrix library is something I wrote.

The WaveHC API accesses the SdReader and FatReader APIs from inside an
interrupt making the LedMatrix flash a lot.  I modified the WaveHC
file to run the LedMatrix state machine more frequently by passing in
a function to run while those libraries are stooging around waiting
for the sdcard to respond.

Notes:

*** Don't leave the plunger turned on with the card un-installed.  The EEPROM 
has a limited number of writes (100,000) over its lifetime.  I fear that 
this would cause the writes to cycle quickly (but this is unconfirmed)

* To further extend the life of the EEPROM, use long LED files and audio clips 
instead of lots of short ones, *or* change th code to write to the EEPROM less 
frequently, if at all.

- The crystal on the original plunger is 20 MHz and the Arduino 
development environment expects 16 MHz board.  I cloned the 16MHz Duemilanove
board description in boards.txt and changed the frequency to 20000000.
