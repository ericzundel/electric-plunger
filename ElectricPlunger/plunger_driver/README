This is the driver shipped with the original Electric plunger on 26 Aug.

It plays .wav files and flashes the LED matrix.
The .wav and .led files must reside in the root directory

Notes:

*** Don't leave the plunger turned on with the card un-installed.  The EEPROM 
has a limited number of writes (1 million) over its lifetime.  I fear that 
this would cause the writes to cycle quickly.

- The crystal on the original plunger is 20 MHz and the Arduino 
development environment expects 16 MHz board.  I cloned the 16MHz Duemilanove
board description in boards.txt and changed the frequency to 20000000.
