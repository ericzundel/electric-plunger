Changed SdCard class and renamed it SdReader to avoid conflicts with other
Arduino libraries.

You must change the name in your sketches.  For example

#include <SdCard.h>
SdCard card;

becomes

#include <SdReader.h>
SdReader card;

Improved error checking in the library and example sketches.

SD_CARD_INFO_SUPPORT is defined as 1 by default for SdReadTest.pde.
You can set it to zero to save flash if you don't need info functions.

Added a status function WaveHC::isPaused() which returns true if the player is paused.

Changed FatReader::open(FatReader &dir, char *name) to use a case independent 
compare so it will find files like "TUNE.WAV" when called with name = "Tune.wav".

Added SdReadTest.pde 

This sketch performs a number of tests on a SD card.

SD_CARD_INFO_SUPPORT must be set to 1 in SdReader.h.

Delete all .o files in the WaveHC folder to force a rebuild of the library.

Added support for AtMega328.

Ladyada's OSX bug fix can be activated by setting OSX_BUG_FIX to 1 in WaveHC.cpp

Added WaveHC::seek(pos) based on Ladyada's seek function.

New dap_hc.pde prints free SRAM size in setup.
