These are the files that were sent to the PCB fab to make the 
prototype circuit board.

 plunger-smt.brd - EAGLE Circuit board layout (http://cadsoft.de)
 plunger-smt.sch - EAGLE Schematic
 parts.txt - exported parts list from Eagle
 plunger-smt.G?? - gerber files sent to the fab (http://barebonespcb.com)
 plunger-smt.TXT - drill file sent to the fab (http://barebonespcb.com)

Here are the problems I found after v0.2.1:

- The Power adapter had leads that required bigger holes than provided by 
  the part.
- Add a power LED
- Add a power switch
- RS232L and USB-TTL cable: RX and TX need to be swapped.
- RS232RL chip: TEST needs to go to GROUND
- RS232RL chip: needs to have DTR wired to reset, not RTS#
- USB-TTL cable: I added a 1K resistor in series for both RX and TX since 
  it is going between 5V and 3.3V logic
- The USB to TTL cable will not work if the 232RL chip is installed because 
  there will be multiple drivers of the serial line.  Since I couldn't get the 
  on-board USB to work, I cut those traces and used the FTDI USB to TTL cable 
  instead.
- The board would have been better designed with the current limiting resistor
  after the PNP transistors instead of in front of the darlington array.   
  Then the LED matrix could cycle through 6 columns instead of 10 rows 
  (less flicker.)
- Add a connection for an external switch to be mounted on the plunger to 
  advance to the next track.  Could use the reset line on SV8.
