These are the files that were sent to the PCB fab to make the 
prototype circuit board.

 plunger-smt.brd - EAGLE Circuit board layout (http://cadsoft.de)
 plunger-smt.sch - EAGLE Schematic
 parts.txt - exported parts list from Eagle
 plunger-smt.G?? - gerber files sent to the fab (http://barebonespcb.com)
 plunger-smt.TXT - drill file sent to the fab (http://barebonespcb.com)

Here are the problems I found after v0.2.1:

- No power LED
- RX and TX need to be swapped.
- I added a 1K resistor in series for both RX and TX
- The USB to TTL cable will not work if the 232RL chip is installed because 
  there will be multiple drivers of the serial line.  Since I couldn't get the 
  on-board USB to work, I cut those traces and used the FTDI USB to TTL cable 
  instead.
- The board would have been better designed with the current limiting resistor
  after the PNP transistors instead of in front of the darlington array.   
  Then the LED matrix could cycle through 6 columns instead of 10 rows 
  (less flicker.)
